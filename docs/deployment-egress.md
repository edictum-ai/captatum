This is one of the most important findings from the 0.11 retest matrix. It is recorded
here so future work does not chase code fixes for what is fundamentally a deployment-
egress problem.

## The finding

A hosted captatum on **AWS Fargate** (the original prod) egresses through an **AWS
datacenter ASN**. A meaningful set of sites detect datacenter egress at the TLS/HTTP
layer — before any page content is served — and respond with a challenge, an interstitial,
or a degraded/slow path:

| Site | Failure on AWS egress | Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Notion** (`*.notion.site`) | `render_empty` / `js-required` — the page's hydration resources are challenged/slowed from AWS, so the client app throws an error boundary instead of hydrating | Cloudflare + Notion's own edge; datacenter-ASN detection |
| **cppreference** | honest Cloudflare `captcha` (`gateReason: captcha`) | Cloudflare managed challenge on datacenter IPs |
| **npmjs** (`npmjs.com`) | Cloudflare `captcha` | Cloudflare managed challenge on datacenter IPs |
| **Cursor docs** (`docs.cursor.com`) | false-positive "Something went wrong" — a first-party resource the Mintlify/Next.js client awaits fails under the HTTPS checked-IP path from AWS | CDN/WAF challenging AWS egress |

A **plain webfetch from a residential IP** succeeds on these same sites — not because
its fetcher is better, but because **its egress IP is residential** and is not
challenged. captatum *on a residential IP* succeeds too (proven — see Evidence).

## Why captatum cannot fix this in code

- captatum's anti-bot TLS/JA3+JA4 fingerprint (`wreq-js`) is **HTTP-only**. HTTPS
  uses a checked-IP Node path with **no fingerprint** (a documented security-required
  limitation — see `docs/contracts.md`). So captatum cannot impersonate a browser's TLS
  handshake over HTTPS to pass a Cloudflare challenge.
- Even if it could, the **datacenter-ASN wall is upstream of the fingerprint**: the
  challenge is triggered by the egress IP's ASN reputation before the handshake
  completes. The #41 research (6-agent evasion study) concluded decisively that
  commercial "bypassers" work almost entirely because they route through **paid
  residential/mobile IP pools** — not because of any browser-layer trick. AWS offers no
  residential egress.
- Therefore no captatum code change (fingerprint, stealth, header) will close this gap
  on a datacenter deployment. The lever is the **egress IP**, which is a deployment
  property.

## Evidence

- **Notion renders correctly from a residential IP**: the exact
  `planetarium.notion.site/Nine-Chronicles-GraphQL-API-Guide-…` page that returns
  `render_empty` on the AWS-hosted connector returns **5982 chars of real article
  content at Tier-3** when captatum runs locally (residential IP), with the **same
  Chromium 149** the prod sidecar uses (`a953bb3`). The code path is identical; only
  the egress differs.
- **cppreference / npmjs** return `gateReason: captcha` from AWS; a residential curl
  gets `200`.
- The **0.11 retest matrix** (53 URLs): captatum-on-AWS loses to residential-webfetch
  precisely on the Cloudflare/anti-bot set (Notion, cppreference, npmjs, Cursor) and
  **nowhere else** — confirming the egress IP, not the fetcher, is the differentiator.

## The solution: a residential-IP host + Cloudflare Tunnel

Run captatum on an **always-on host with a residential ISP IP** (e.g. a Mac mini) and
expose it through a **Cloudflare Tunnel** (the inbound path is unchanged; only the
**outbound** egress moves to residential). The Cloudflare Tunnel carries *inbound*
traffic (claude.ai/ChatGPT → captatum); it does **not** proxy captatum's *outbound*
fetches — those egress directly from the residential host, which is the whole point.

- **No code change.** captatum's hosted flavor (HTTP server + OAuth) runs unchanged.
- **No new SSRF surface.** The `FetcherPort` rebinding-proof guard still pins every
  outbound connection; only the source IP changes.
- **No paid proxy.** The residential IP is the host's own ISP — free.
- **The browser sidecar** (Chromium) runs on the same host (Docker sidecar or
  in-process), so Tier-3 renders also egress residential.

See **[`deploy/mac-mini.md`](../deploy/mac-mini.md)** for the step-by-step (Docker +
`cloudflared` + Cloudflare Access). The `docker-compose.yml` base is the same one used
for EC2/any Docker host.

### Verification before cutover

Confirm the host's IP is clean (not a challenged/CGNAT/business IP):

```sh
curl -sI https://www.npmjs.com/package/react        # expect 200, not a challenge
curl -sI https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/ranges/sort
curl -sI https://qogita.notion.site/               # any notion.site page
```

If any returns a Cloudflare challenge (`403`/`503` + challenge body), the IP is flagged
and the residential-host benefit won't apply (some ISPs use CGNAT or business ranges).
A typical home ISP IP passes.

## Trade-offs vs the AWS deployment

| | AWS Fargate (datacenter) | Residential host (Mac mini) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Egress IP** | datacenter ASN — challenged by CF/anti-bot sites | residential — not challenged |
| **Availability** | HA, multi-AZ, self-healing | single-point (one host; power/ISP outages) |
| **Cost** | pay-per-use | free (host you own) |
| **Ops** | managed (ECS, auto-restart) | you keep it on + restart on failure |
| **SSRF/security posture** | identical (`FetcherPort` guard; browser in a sidecar container) | identical |
| **Coverage** | loses Notion/cppreference/npmjs/Cursor | wins them |

For a personal / low-traffic product, the residential host's coverage win outweighs the
HA loss — especially with the AWS stack kept as a cold fallback (or decommissioned once
the residential deploy is stable). The Cloudflare Tunnel + Access front-door is identical
either way, so the **inbound** trust boundary (OAuth, CF Access on `/oauth/authorize*`)
does not change.

## What this does NOT change

- **Tier-1/2/3 code, the SSRF guard, the shell-gate, POST forwarding (#111), the React
  streaming-SSR fix (#118), the extraction budget** — all unchanged. The residential
  deploy is purely an egress change.
- **Sites that are *genuinely* gated** (paywalled, login-walled) are still gated — a
  residential IP doesn't bypass auth. The wall this doc addresses is the **datacenter-ASN
  challenge**, not access control.
- **The `FetcherPort` SSRF guarantees hold** — residential egress still routes through
  the rebinding-proof guard; private IPs are still blocked.
